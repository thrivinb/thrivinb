My name is Vineeth. I'm a software engineer currently working at PayPal, in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.

I've graduated from National University of Singapore (NUS) with Highest Distinction in a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I was awarded the top-tier NUS Global Merit Scholarship and was also recognised in the Dean's List.

Professionally, I seek opportunities in full-stack software engineering, where I can either make use of my past experiences in Java, React, JavaScript, Python, C++ or learn new technologies altogether!

Being able to both design and develop is a lot of fun. When you have an idea, thereâ€™s nothing holding you back from building it.
