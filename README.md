## Hello world! I'm Vineeth. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub.

I am a Computer Science undergraduate scholar from the National University of Singapore.

I am deeply interested in building meaningful products that can deliver high-value to people. I have big dreams of becoming a highly competent Full-Stack Software Engineer who can offer tremendous value to organisations and consumers.

Currently, I am focusing on building my technical capabilities through software development internships, self-initiated projects and proactive learning.

With my early exposure to public speaking, sport and leadership, I have also honed a knack for effective communication and excelling in team environments. I want to make the best out of these skills to accelerate my learning journey and achieve my vision.

Check out my work here on GitHub or on vineethbuddha.com

For any queries or opportunities, do email me at buddhavineeth@gmail.com or message me on LinkedIn directly.

Have a great day and thank you for stopping by!
